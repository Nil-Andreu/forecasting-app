# Real-Time Map
In this project, I will create a real-time map.

We will use **Kafka**, as a low-latency queue streaming processor.
For the backend we will use FastAPI, to create the APIs needed to process the data into the frontend.
For the frontend, we will use the tool of Leaflet.JS, which will help us to create the map.
